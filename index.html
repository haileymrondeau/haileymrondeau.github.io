                <p>Lily Beaufort is a high school graduate spending one last winter break with her friends. She wants nothing more than to freeze time and prevent everyone from moving on—but freezing time is impossible. So, she does the next best thing and extensively photographs every memory. However, Lily's photographs are anything but a faithful representation of these memories; instead, they're mirrors of everything she wishes they had been. So consumed by this idealistic series of events, Lily fails to realize just how much distance this hobby of hers has created between her and her friends.</p>
                <p>In “Lens of Reverie,” Lily must rediscover her memories and mend her friendships after her photographs alter her perception of reality. This journey will force her to decide what is more important to her: her fantasies, or her friends?</p>

                <p>Graduating high school is one of the biggest changes in our lives. People move away, friends grow distant, and we're left with endless possibilities on how to move forward and no idea which path to take. For those of us who struggle to embrace change, it feels like our lives are ending, and all we can do to stop it is cling onto the past.</p>
                <p>As someone with generalized anxiety disorder and autism, I crave the routine that school has brought to my life. Throughout my final year of high school, developing Lens of Reverie was my way of coping with all the rapid changes and the end of the school routine I’d known for years. In many ways, Lily’s story is a reflection of my own, and I would love to produce this film as a way to bring this chapter of both our stories to a close.</p>
